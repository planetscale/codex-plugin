# PlanetScale database skills

Pick the one engine skill that matches the database in front of you and follow it. Read only that skill; the engines disagree on enough details that mixing their guidance produces wrong advice.

## Pick an engine

| Database | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL-compatible, unsharded | `mysql` |
| PlanetScale Postgres | `postgres` |
| Vitess (sharded MySQL, keyspaces, VSchema) | `vitess` |
| Neki (sharded Postgres) | `neki` |

If you do not know which engine backs the database, determine it with the PlanetScale MCP server before choosing — do not infer it from the connection string, ORM, or repository conventions.
